# `Rem.Core.ComponentModel` Package

This package is a small, lightweight library of common component-model-like tools with common applications in .NET, including the following:

* `Rem.Core.ComponentModel.PropertySetException` - An exception type that can be thrown when a property is set to an invalid value
* `Rem.Core.ComponentModel.IDefaultDeterminableStruct` - An interface for structs that need to be able to differentiate the default case from other cases
* `Rem.Core.ComponentModel.INotifyNestedPropertyChanging`, `Rem.Core.ComponentModel.INotifyNestedPropertyChanged` - Nested property change interfaces
